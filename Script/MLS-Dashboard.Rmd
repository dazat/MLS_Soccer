### Player Nationality

The United States, Argentina, Brazil, and Canada all have the most players in the MLS. The 5th group is a combination of players with no nationality data. 

In addition, I need to fix the labels here  

```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=14}

## Plot of player average minutes and average comp by country
nation_player_plot <- Players_all_17_20_Reg_Nation %>%
  group_by(Player) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = country_mins, y = country_comp)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = n), colour = ifelse(Players_all_17_20_Reg_Nation$n > 20,"darkorchid","gray"), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(data = Players_all_17_20_Reg_Nation |> dplyr::filter(n > 20),
            aes(label = country_name), check_overlap = TRUE, nudge_y = 0.1, nudge_x = -0.12) +
  scale_size_binned(name = "Players per Country", breaks = c(5,25,50)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Average Minutes played per season by country", 
       y = "Average Total compensation by country") +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') +
  labs(title = "Higher paid players tend to play more", subtitle = "Average Player minutes by Average Total Compensation with player nationality")

I need to fix the sizing here to make it legible. Maybe I can do it in plotly?   

### Player Nationality by Club in 2017

 facet_wrap(~ Club, nrow=4) +
  labs(y = "",x = "", title = "Player region of origin by Club in 2017") +
